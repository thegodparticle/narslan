**Introduction**

Music appreciation through electric hearing in postlingually
deafened and implanted cochlear implant (CI) users often
faces limitations, given their prior acoustic-hearing experience.
Research has shown that this group benefits from music
preprocessing strategies such as remixing songs to attenuate
instruments with rich harmonic structures (e.g., Buyens et al.,
2014; Pons et al., 2016). However, the optimal adjustment levels in
musical sources vary among individuals and studies. Prior
research on music remixing primarily tested postlingually
deafened and implanted adult CI users, whose preferences for
remixed music may be shaped by their musical experiences
with pre-implant acoustic hearing, in great contrast to
CI-mediated music. On the other hand, prelingually deafened
and implanted CI users formed their musical preferences solely
through electric hearing, which may result in different responses
to remixed music.

**Aims and Hypotheses**

The main purpose of this study was to fill the knowledge gap
on music perception in general, and music remixing
preferences in specific, of teenage and young adult CI users
who were prelingually deafened and implanted.

We hypothesized that:

- The postlingual group may prefer attenuation of
background music relative to vocals, while the prelingual
group may favor small or no modifications to the songs,
possibly due to their higher musical sophistication scores.

- For individual songs and participants, higher levels of song
familiarity may lead to higher preference ratings for the
original songs.

- Lower levels of vocal pleasantness would result in higher
preference ratings for vocals-attenuated versions but lower
preference ratings for music-attenuated versions.

**Key Findings**

- Compared to the postlingual group, the prelingual group
had higher musical sophistication scores and significantly
different patterns of preference ratings for the remixed
versions of Spotifyâ€™s most streamed songs. The prelingual
group preferred the Original and Music-6 versions the most
but the Vocals-12 version the least, while the postlingual
group preferred the Vocals-12 version over the Music-12
version.

- The prelingual group was significantly more familiar with the
songs than the postlingual group. However, song familiarity
did not significantly affect the patterns of preference ratings
for each group.

- The prelingual group rated vocal pleasantness significantly
higher than the postlingual group. Vocal pleasantness
significantly influenced preference patterns in both groups.
For the prelingual group, higher vocal pleasantness
increased preference for the Music-12 and Music-3-3-12
versions. For the postlingual group, their overall preference
for the Vocals-12 version was mainly driven by their
preference ratings for songs with very unpleasant vocals.
